        <p style="text-align: left;">Signs and symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may appear two to 14 days after exposure. This time after exposure and before having symptoms is called the incubation period. Common signs and symptoms can include:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Fever</strong> : 88 percent of infected people have experienced fever</li>
            <li><strong>Cough</strong> : 67.7 percent of infected people complained of dry cough</li>
            <li><strong>Thick Mucus from Coughs</strong> : Reported by 33.4 percent of the infected people</li>
            <li><strong>Shortness of Breath</strong> : Found in 18.6 percent of the infected people</li>
            <li><strong>Sore Throat</strong> : 13.9 percent infected people had a Sore Throat</li>
            <li><strong>Headache</strong> : 13.6 percent of the infected people had mild headaches</li>
            
        </ul>

        <h2 style="margin: 30px 0; text-align: left;"><img src="covid bgless.png" alt="Virus strain">&nbspIf you have symptoms, what to do?</h2>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The CDC advises people to seek medical attention immediately if they have trouble breathing or emergency warning signs like persistent chest pain, confusion, and bluish lips.</p>

        <p style="text-align: left;">People with symptoms in one of the high-risk groups — those who are over 65 years old; people with diabetes, hypertension, or preexisting breathing problems; or people being treated for cancer — should quickly seek medical advice or treatment. Call your health care provider before heading to a clinic if you suspect you may have Covid-19. That way, the clinic can take appropriate precautions for your visit.</p>
            
        <p style="text-align: left;">If you’re not in a high-risk group and have symptoms, mild or severe, you should also call a health professional — a doctor, a nurse, or a public health official. They will work with your local health department and figure out whether you need to get tested or get treatment. And make no mistake: While older people face the highest risks, all age groups can get sick from Covid-19, so everyone needs to take precautions and pay attention to their symptoms.</p>
